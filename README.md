## It's my first, senpai!
** Hi, everyone!** My name is Gleb, and I'm a biologist from Russia, inspired to do some code 😏
I have recently finished several courses on Kaggle.com, and I'm looking forward to start something "my own". 
In the nearest future I'm planning on applying on masters degree, so I really need to find a job to be able to pay for it!
There's the list of what exactly I need to achieve in order to do so:
-[ ] Get myself a nice GitHub profile
-[ ] Make several projects
-[ ] Fit them well into CV
-[ ] Quit my current microbiologist job (and that part MUST be the last one!)
